intro: |
  This is a physical computing workshop.
  You will start with an introduction to NodeMCU and some basics you will probably need to do an IoT (Internet of Things) project yourself.
  Then it will be all hands-on. You will go through some examples and start building our own little projects right away. You will mostly work within the Arduino programming environment, but there will also be simple tasks in Html, Javascript and php. But don't worry, there will be sample code for everything and you will go through it step by step.
  Come along and have some fun.

outro: |
  The workshop will be held by Studio CIRG, is hosted by the Retune Studio, and supported by Host Europe.
  CIRG is an invention and education studio. They challenge, prototype, and communicate future technologies and experiences, bringing them to life before they become products to be designed for people.

Participants should bring a computer and have very basic knowledge about arduino and web. (if you at least heard of »void setup()«, »digitalWrite()«, »html und javascript« you will be fine!)

Please download the Arduino Software (IDE) beforehand as well as Processing.
