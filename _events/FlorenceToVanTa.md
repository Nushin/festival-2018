intro: |
  A live performance during the festival's closing night using analogue video synthesis, sound and signal processing. The artists Florence To and VanTa have worked within the audiovisual field designing and coding large-scale installations and live performances for over 8 years. After meeting in Berlin performing experimental sessions in various artistic hubs, they began collaborating on a visual approach using modular systems rich in colour, rhythm and geometry. The performance translates a process in visualising sound and colour through sculpting waves using modular devices, creating a spectrum of rhythmic images in space throughout a live progressive performance.

  Florence To is an art director and artist designing and producing sound and light installations, also creating generative motion graphics and light productions with a strong focus on architectural spatial design on site specific projects. Through working in various disparate environments she ventured further into exploring the effects of cognitive and emotional triggers, and how different sensory arrangements are experienced within space. The Scottish artist has established residencies at the Société des Arts Technologiques [SAT] in Montreal, 4DSOUND Spatial Sound Institute in Budapest, and has exhibited, performed and given workshops at Southbank Centre in London and LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial in Gijon supported by the European Network for Contemporary Audiovisual Creation [ENCAC]. In 2017 she was awarded a creative fellowship with the DCN (Department of Clinical Neuroscience) in Edinburgh.

  VanTa is a digital Alter Ego. After studying Environmental Sciences in Granada University in Spain, he began his career as a visual designer as part of the audiovisual collective Miga. Since moving to Berlin, he began working at the mythical record label M-nus, where he became part of the developer team at 2V-P. VanTa is a creative coder for various design studios such as NEEEU and Pfadfinderei, he teaches programming for technicians and designers in the theatre school of Andalusia as well as collaborating with many artistic and commercial projects. He has performed at festivals such as Sonar, Melt, Lowlands, Lehrter17 and FRAC working with generative audio, virtual reality and light design showcasing in Asia, South America, Europe and the States.
