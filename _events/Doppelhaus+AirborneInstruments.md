intro: |
  Textile designer Yolanda Leask (Doppelhaus Kunsthochschule Weissensee) and musicians Hannes Hoelzl and Isak Han (AirborneInstruments, Universität der Künste Berlin) give a short talk about their projects and companies.

  AirborneInstruments explores the combination of bodily movement and digital technologies for musical expression. The NTMI – NonTrivial Music Instrument – is a new digital musical instrument facilitating a unique form of intuitive gestural play supported by its wireless interface and special software architecture. Different from convenient musical interfaces it can be moved freely in space, while tilt, orientation and acceleration influence the sounding music.

  Doppelhaus Ltd is a textile company specialising in utilising non-woven technology for the creation of high-quality fabrics. The novel approach involves meticulous consideration and research into supply chains, sustainability and surface technology/design.

  Both funded with the Berlin Startup Grant of the European Social Fund and the Berlin Senate Departement for Economics they discus the impact of this grant.

  Isak Han (KOR) is a product designer, musician, composes music mainly by means of hardware circuit bending, software programming and personal instrument design.
