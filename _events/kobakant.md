intro: |
  KOBAKANT is currently running a one-year art project in Berlin which is a tailor shop for electronic textiles and wearable technology. Their shop proposes that if there was the option to have technology custom made, we would be making different kinds of technology. They would like to speculate with you how the technology will develop in future, and how its production and consumption will take place. What is the ideal scenario? Can we imagine the future without a dark dystopian end?
  They invite you to join them for 2 hours of discussion and brainstorming session to speculate the technology for future we want to live in. As Retune is an art, design and technology festival, they expect many people in the audience to be involved creatively in technology, providing them with the strength to imagine what they want.

  Mika Satomi and Hannah Perner-Wilson have been collaborating since 2006, and in 2008 formed the collective KOBAKANT. Together, through their work, they explore the use of textile crafts and electronics as a medium for commenting on technological aspects of today’s “high-tech” society. KOBAKANT believes in the spirit of humoring technology, often presenting their work as a twisted criticism of the stereotypes surrounding textile craftsmanship and electrical engineering. KOBAKANT believes that technology exists to be hacked, handmade and modified by everyone to better fit our personal needs and desires. In 2009, as research fellows at the Distance Lab in Scotland, KOBAKANT published an online database for sharing their DIY wearable technology approach titled HOW TO GET WHAT YOU WANT. In 2017, KOBAKANT has received WEAR sustain funding to realize an eTextile tailor shop. The project is currently running in Kreuzberg Berlin.
