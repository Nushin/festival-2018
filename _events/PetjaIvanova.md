intro: |
  An inspirational talk about »A New Materialist Cyborg - thoughts on post-technological becomings«. The Styroworm transverses the boundaries between the artificial and the natural. What we can learn from its actions to rethinking the Cyborg and our existences as assemblages and assemblage-converters.  

outro: |
  Petja Ivanova founded "Studio for Poetic Futures" in Berlin out of frustration with the domination of the scientific method in the field of (computational) art. She works with electronics and organisms to explain which forms poetry can take in media art and art with complex systems.
