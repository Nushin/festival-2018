intro: |
  When AI agents are part of everyday objects, how can we go beyond human-centered-design? Drawing from Design Anthropology and a new discipline called Machine Behaviour, this talk will examine how algorithms are 'enacted' by everyday objects in the Internet of Things, and propose new design methods to practice a more-than-human-centered-design.

  Iohanna Nicenboim is a design researcher at the Connected Everyday Lab (TU Delft). She focuses on connected objects as part of complex socio-technical systems in everyday futures. Following a Research through Design process, and using unconventional methods, she investigates interactions in the area of IoT, AI, Machine Learning, Social Sciences.
  Nicenboim’s design practice often shows a provocative approach towards the Internet of Things, using techniques from Speculative Design and Design Fiction. She received the Internet of Things Award for the Best Design Fiction project in 2015-16, and the Thingscon IoT fellowship in 2017. She participated in residency programs, gave talks and exhibited her work in different international exhibitions and conferences, like CHI, DIS, FutureEverything, Transmediale, Milan Design Week and Dutch Design Week.
