intro: |
  You finally want to build that transformers robot? Have that self-driving skateboard? Tune your electrical toothbrush? - Well, you better know how to control a motor then. And you will learn it in this workshop! Konstruktiv will take you on a safari through the world of motor control and lead you through our pet zoo of practical examples.

outro: |
  Konstruktiv has been building and hacking electrically driven stuff for years. Agile Product Development and Rapid Prototyping.
  We bring ingenious ideas to life: from a first prototype all the way to bulk production.
  We cover the whole development process from ideation, embedded software, elctronics, mechanics to rapid prototyping. We design complex and detailed models of mechanical parts and PCBs and make them real in our well-equipped workshop including 3D-printers, turning lathe, CNC-mill and all sorts of other tools.
