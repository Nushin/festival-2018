intro: |
  How can forms, colors, sounds, scents, surfaces, objects, interactions and movements contribute to spaces where flow and creativity emerge naturally? How can we map our rooms to our mind and decorate them for clarity and joy?
  In this talk on »Conscious spaces«, the Berlin design studio RLON shares its insights and inspirations around the topic. The studio is dedicated to create objects and kinetic installations for what they call “curious spaces”.
  If you are curious in what this looks like and how objects and spaces affect your state of mind, join us for this talk in their studio.

outro: |
  RLON is a Berlin design and concept studio founded by Philipp Eibach, Josua Putzke and Nehemia Turban. The studio creates objects and installations characterized by minimal aesthetics, playful interactions and poetic motions. RLON’s works arise out of an particular interest in meta physics, spatial cognition and experiments with materials and processes.

  As children of a rising global consciousness, the three founders understand design as one way to widen our imagination of the future and to encourage individual and confident constructions of realities: “the future is less a shadow of yesterday than a reflection of now. what we think, is what we get. so let us think sassy, brave and juicy. let us connect the dots not straight but curved. we believe we can contribute to such a liquid thinking, by crafting interactions and narrating stories that trigger awareness and reward curiosity. with the tools of design and the soul of art. so this is what studio RLON does: creating objects and narratives for curious spaces. and curious minds.”
