intro: |
  GORILLAS turns Silent Green’s courtyard, the entrance to the old crematory, into a living ecosystem of sound objects. Together, the objects create an evolving soundscape where light, fog and sound come together as a narrative environment. The audience can interact with the objects, close/mute or move them in space.

  Don't miss out when the clock strikes 20:15 as the installation will then move into an elevated interactive performance once the sun goes down and the atmosphere of the space transforms.

  KLING KLANG KLONG is a creative studio for sound, music and acoustic narratives based in Berlin. Our work stands in the intersection between art, science and communication. As a result, our projects create new pioneering approaches to communicate with audiences through exhibition spaces, motion pictures, interactive installations, performances and public spaces.
