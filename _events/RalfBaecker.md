intro: |
  The lecture »Matter Matters« looks at the origin of the digital and how artists and designers nowadays are trying to reclaim matter and raw material processes into their artistic practice. The digital procedure, introduced in the 1940s, was intended to eliminate not only the noise in the channel and its surroundings but matter itself. For this lecture Ralf Baecker will use his own artistic practice to reflect and comment on the digital.

outro: |
  Ralf Baecker is an artist working at the intersection of art, science and technology. Through installations and machines, Baecker explores fundamental mechanisms of action and effects of new media and technologies. At the core of his objects lies the entanglement of the virtual with the real, or rather, with the world. With a media-archaeological outlook, Ralf Baecker digs within obsolete devices for traces and functions that are still detectable in technologies today.
  Since 2016, he teaches at the University of the Arts Bremen as Professor for Experimental Design of New Technologies.
