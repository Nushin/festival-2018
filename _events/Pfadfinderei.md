intro: |
  The Monolith is a video sculpture which aesthetically melts screen and content. In a play between natural beauty and technical disruption, images of classical busts transform cyclically into abstract gradients and turn again into perceptible images.

outro: |
  Pfadfinderei is a Berlin-based design and motion graphics studio specializing in creative services for stage entertainment, large-format media installations, tradeshows and events. Founded 1998 in Berlin, Pfadfinderei started as a design studio focused on print, fonts and logos designs. In 2000 the studio added motion content, live video performances, audio visual cooperations and room- and video installations to its repertoire. A reductionist approach to creativity are hallmark and signature style of Pfadfinderei.
