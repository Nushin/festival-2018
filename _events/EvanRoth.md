intro: |
  Evan Roth will discuss in his keynote »Landscape, Signal and Empire« his experiences making art at fiber optic cable landing locations around the globe and his recently released project, Red Lines. The presentation will connect Romance period landscape painting, peer to peer networks, infrared photography, social media fatigue and British imperialism. 

outro: |
  Evan Roth is an artist based in Berlin whose practice visualizes and archives typically unseen aspects of rapidly changing communication technologies. Through a range of media from sculpture to websites, the work addresses the personal and cultural effects surrounding these changes and the role of individual agency within the media landscape. Roth’s work has been exhibited at the Tate, Whitechapel Gallery and he is the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art NYC.
