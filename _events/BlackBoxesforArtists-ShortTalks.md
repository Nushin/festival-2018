intro: |
  "My Artificial Muse" is a performance by Albert Barqué-Duran, Mario Klingemann and Marc Marzenit, premiered at Sónar+D (2017) and now in a World Tour, exploring how an Artificial Neural Network can collaborate with humans in the creative and artistic processes. What is a Muse? Who can be a Muse? Where can we find a Muse? Can a Muse be “artificial”? Do they need to be “physical”? Can a computer-generated Muse be as inspiring as a human-like one? By destroying the classic concept of a Muse, are we creating something better? The artistic fruit of Artificial Intelligence (Computational Creativity) is a growing area of research and is increasingly seeping into the public consciousness. We will discuss how to integrate Artificial Intelligence as a creative collaborator in artistic processes.

  "Creative AI" covers the development of deep and reinforcement learning algorithms that expanded the range of technologies available to today’s artists and designers to include self-learning systems that are not only tools and techniques, but creative partners in their own right. With their help, artists can generate new texts, sounds and images based on their chosen data, explore questions of machine perception and imagine futures of human and machine co-existence. What are the new forms of storytelling, design and expression made possible with machine learning? How do these tools influence the artist?

  The trained computer vision researcher Appu Shaji discusses in "Recording the Visual whether or not machines can help us capture a part of visual taste and identity.

  With Albert Barqué-Duran, Appu Shaji (Mobius Labs) and Samim Winiger (samim.io).

  Curated and moderated by Luba Elliott (co-curator of the Impakt Festival 2018 and Creative AI researcher)"


outro: |
  Albert is a Postdoctoral Researcher in Cognitive Science and a Contemporary Artist at City University of London. Albert’s research concerns new approaches and frameworks for cognitive modelling and judgment and decision-making. His artwork and performances are inspired by his research and combine classical techniques from fine arts such as oil painting, data, digital arts and experimental electronic music. He leads disruptive projects at the intersection of art and research with the aim of finding novel formats of generating scientific knowledge to reflect about contemporary and futuristic issues and its cultural implications. He has exhibited and performed at Sónar+D(Barcelona, Spain), Creative Reactions(London, UK), Cambridge Neuroscience Society (Cambridge, UK), Max Planck (Berlin, Germany), SciArt Center (New York, USA).

  Samim Wininger is a designer and code magician, doing Research and Projects at the intersection of  Machine Learning, Human-Computer-Interaction, Generative Design and Mindful Creativity. He's interested in a range of ideas, but his focus lies on building tools for enlightenment.

  Appu Shaji is the CEO and Chief Scientist at Mobius Labs GmbH, a stealth computer vision startup based in Berlin. Previously he was the Head of Research and Development at EyeEm, where he led a team that was building state of art computer vision based image recognition and ranking systems. Appu co-founded sight.io, where he and his team developed technology to rate images based on computational aesthetics. Sight.io was acquired by EyeEm in 2014. Prior to that, Appu was a post-doctoral researcher in the Image and Visual Representation Group and Computer Vision Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. He received a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay.
