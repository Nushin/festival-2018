intro: |
  The immersive video exhibition Colours X Colours is the result of the collaboration between Oilhack and Thomas Blanchard, Two artists / painters combining their know-how and inspiration to create unique works. Their standards drive them forward each and every day to come out with innovative combinations and new techniques.
