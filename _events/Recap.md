intro: |
  We are closing the first day of the festival. The moderators Alex Wolf, Fernanda Parente and Christian Zöllner will recapitulate their very personal perspective of the day with a beer. What stuck to their mind? What was the absolute highlight? And with which speaker, they'd definitely want to arm wrestle at the bar afterwards?
