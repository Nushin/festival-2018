  FELD is a design company passionate about uniting the physical and the digital to find new ways of communicating stories and creating experiences that bridge design and engineering, art and architecture, science and society, machines and people, numbers and feelings. 

  Founded in 2011, the studio works with clients across all industries to accomplish unique communication projects, interactive environments, spatial installations and exhibitions. 

  FELD believes in a collaborative and interdisciplinary design process. At our Berlin studio, designers, architects and engineers work and create with content specialists, researchers and project managers. We think, plan, prototype and realize – together.
